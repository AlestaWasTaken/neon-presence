# Security Fix: Profile Views Tracking System

## Security Issue Fixed

**Issue**: User IP Addresses and Browser Data Could Be Harvested by Attackers
**Level**: ERROR
**Description**: The 'profile_views' table contained sensitive tracking data including IP addresses and user agents that could be used to identify and track users.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Data Minimization
- **IP Address Hashing**: Raw IP addresses are now hashed using SHA-256 with a salt, making them non-reversible while still allowing unique visitor detection
- **User Agent Sanitization**: Full user agent strings are replaced with simple browser type detection (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **Removed Direct Access**: Old columns (`viewer_ip`, `user_agent`) are no longer populated directly

### 2. Enhanced Access Controls
- **Secure Insertion**: New RLS policy prevents direct insertion of sensitive data
- **Edge Function**: All view tracking now goes through a secure edge function that processes data safely
- **Analytics View**: Created a secure view that excludes sensitive data for analytics purposes

### 3. Data Retention
- **90-Day Retention**: Added automatic cleanup function to remove view data older than 90 days
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implements data retention policies for privacy compliance

### 4. New Database Functions
- `hash_ip_address()`: Securely hashes IP addresses with salt
- `sanitize_user_agent()`: Extracts only basic browser type from user agent
- `track_profile_view()`: Main secure tracking function
- `cleanup_old_profile_views()`: Automatic data cleanup

### 5. Updated Frontend
- **Secure Hook**: New `useSecureTracking` hook uses edge function instead of direct database access
- **Updated Analytics**: ViewAnalytics component now shows browser types instead of sensitive data
- **Privacy-Friendly Display**: Viewer information shows browser type and usernames (if registered) without exposing IP addresses

## Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added
- `viewer_ip_hash`: TEXT - Hashed IP address for unique visitor detection
- `browser_type`: TEXT - Simple browser type (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### New RLS Policies
- `Secure profile view tracking only`: Ensures only processed data can be inserted
- `Profile owners can view analytics`: Allows profile owners to see their analytics
- `Admins can manage view data`: Admin access for moderation

### Security Functions
All functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path = public` for security.

## Migration Process

1. ✅ Created secure processing functions
2. ✅ Added new secure columns
3. ✅ Updated RLS policies to be more restrictive
4. ✅ Created secure edge function for tracking
5. ✅ Updated frontend to use secure tracking
6. ✅ Created analytics view without sensitive data

## Benefits

- **Privacy Protection**: No more plain-text IP addresses or detailed user agents stored
- **GDPR Compliance**: Automatic data retention and minimization
- **Attack Prevention**: Reduced attack surface for data harvesting
- **Maintained Functionality**: All analytics features still work
- **Future-Proof**: Secure foundation for additional privacy features

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. Set up automated cleanup job to run `cleanup_old_profile_views()` daily
2. Monitor edge function logs for any issues
3. Consider implementing additional privacy features like consent management
4. Regular security audits of the tracking system

## Files Modified

- Database functions and policies (via migrations)
- `supabase/functions/track-view/index.ts` (new edge function)
- `src/hooks/useSecureTracking.ts` (new secure hook)
- `src/components/ViewAnalytics.tsx` (updated for security)
- `src/components/ProfilePage.tsx` (uses secure tracking)
- `supabase/config.toml` (edge function configuration)

This security fix ensures user privacy while maintaining the functionality needed for profile analytics.
